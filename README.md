# DropWizard RAML API Resource Bundle

This bundle allows a RAML specification to be attached to the resources of the service, exposing a human-readable, HTML representation of the RAML specification on the `/api` resource.

## RAML Specification

The RAML specification documentation can be found [`here`](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec)

## DropWizard Compatability

This project has both a DropWizard 0.6 and a DropWizard 0.7 compatibility build.

Checkout the branch you need compatability with and compile.  
 
### DropWizard 0.6 Version Numbers

Version numbers are in the format `0.6-<library revision>` (eg. `0.6-1`)

### DropWizard 0.7 Version Numbers

Version numbers are in the format `0.7-<library revision>` (eg. `0.7-2`)

### Future DropWizard Versions

Version numbers will continue to follow the pattern of DropWizards `<major>.<minor>-<library revision>` structure.

### Legacy DropWizard 0.6 Versions

The following versions are now considered `DEPRECATED`, but still acceptable for use in DropWizard 0.6:

+ `1.0.0`
+ `1.0.1`
+ `1.0.2`
+ `1.0.3`
+ `1.0.4`
+ `1.0.5`
+ `1.1.0`

## Endpoints

The following endpoints will be made available on your service:

+ `/api` - The API specification as a HTML viewable endpoint.
+ `/api/raw` - The raw RAML specification as re-emitted from the RAML JSON Parser.

## Example Usage

To add this bundle to your service and expose a RAML specification under the `/api` resource.

```java
bootstrap.addBundle(ApiSpecsBundle.bundle("apispecs/apispecs.raml"));
```

## Functionality Caveat

This project currently provides functionality that meet my usage needs for RAML specifications.  It is by no means a comprehensive HTML representation of the RAML specification.  This means particular components that other people need _will_ be missing.
